//! Recipient address history for compose autocomplete.
//!
//! This is a read/write view over the EXISTING `contacts` table — there is no
//! second address book. [`Database::reconcile_address_history`] folds locally
//! cached mail metadata into contacts, and [`Database::suggest_addresses`]
//! ranks them for the To/Cc/Bcc fields.
//!
//! Three local sources feed the history, all already on disk:
//!   * `thread_messages` joined to `threads` — the deep cache of everyone this
//!     account has corresponded with, inbound senders and outbound recipients
//!     alike. This is the bulk source: a real install holds six figures of
//!     rows here against a few hundred in the dashboard's index. From, To, Cc,
//!     and Bcc are all read; Cc/Bcc are `NULL` on rows the scan cached before
//!     Envelope retained them and fill in as scans revisit those folders.
//!   * `indexed_message_summaries` — the dashboard's rolling INBOX snapshot,
//!     which is where display names come from.
//!   * `drafts` with `status = 'sent'` — recipients you have written to but
//!     whose Sent copy the thread scan has not reached yet. This source is
//!     also folded in the instant a send becomes durable, so someone you just
//!     wrote to is suggestible without waiting for anything; see
//!     [`Database::record_sent_draft_recipients`].
//!
//! None of them is IMAP, so reconciling never opens a socket and typing in a
//! compose field never leaves the machine.
//!
//! ## Why a watermark, and what invalidates it
//!
//! `thread_messages.id` is `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`, so it is
//! monotonic and never reused. `address_history_state.last_thread_message_id`
//! records how far up that sequence an account has been folded in;
//! reconciling picks up above the watermark and advances it in the same
//! transaction as the contact writes. A refresh therefore costs the rows that
//! actually arrived, not a rescan of the whole thread cache, and a crash
//! between the two either rolls both back or commits both.
//!
//! The watermark alone would be a lie, because `thread_messages` is not
//! append-only. Two paths change rows at or below it:
//!
//!   * `upsert_thread_message` rewrites a cached row in place when a folder is
//!     re-scanned, so a corrected From/To/Cc/Bcc, date, or direction would
//!     otherwise never be seen again;
//!   * `reset_folder_sync` deletes a folder's rows after a UIDVALIDITY change,
//!     and the rescan re-inserts the same messages under fresh ids — every one
//!     of which is above the watermark and would be counted twice.
//!
//! Both call [`Database::invalidate_address_history`], which sets
//! `address_history_state.dirty`. A dirty account reconciles like a
//! source-version bump: derived counts are dropped and re-folded from the
//! first thread message. The in-place path compares the stored address-bearing
//! fields against the incoming ones first, so an unchanged rescan — the common
//! case — costs nothing.
//!
//! The other two sources are rewritten in place (`upsert_indexed_message_summaries`
//! deletes and re-inserts each folder; a draft's timestamps move as it is
//! edited), so they cannot be watermarked. They are small and bounded, so
//! every completed reconcile recounts them from scratch and merges the total
//! as a high-water mark, which is idempotent by construction.
//!
//! ## What a reconcile may and may not overwrite
//!
//! `history_count` and `history_sent_count` are the derived half of the
//! interaction signal and the only contact columns this module owns.
//! `message_count`, `name`, `tags`, and `notes` belong to `envelope contacts
//! add|import` and manual edits: a reconcile fills a blank name and otherwise
//! leaves them alone, so a rebuild is free to lower or reset the derived count
//! without a stale copy of it surviving in the manual column. Suggestions rank
//! on whichever of the three is higher.
//!
//! ## Why the sent-draft count has its own column
//!
//! A send must not have to wait for a reconcile to make its recipients
//! suggestible, and the write that runs at the send edge must not distort the
//! count once the same message comes back around through the Sent folder.
//! Those two are only compatible if the immediate write and the reconcile
//! account for the message separately, so `history_sent_count` holds the
//! locally recorded sent-draft signal and `history_count` holds everything
//! else. The immediate edge writes only the former, the thread-cache fold
//! writes only the latter, and the suggestion signal takes the larger — so the
//! Sent-folder row arriving later lands on a count that never absorbed the
//! send edge's write, and comes out exactly where it would have without it.
//!
//! Both are recomputed floors, never increments: the immediate edge recounts
//! the same bounded sent-draft window the reconcile reads, so running it twice
//! for one send is indistinguishable from running it once. Once a reconcile
//! completes, `history_sent_count` is subsumed by `history_count` (which
//! recounts the same drafts among its own sources), so the column only
//! decides anything in the window between a send and the next reconcile.
//!
//! ## Who owns a row
//!
//! `contacts.history_derived` says whether a row is this module's. A row a
//! reconcile invented is marked derived; anything `envelope contacts` creates
//! or edits — adding a contact, tagging one, annotating one, including taking
//! over a row that started out derived — is manual from that point on.
//! Observing a manual address in a header does not change that: history writes
//! the derived count and nothing else.
//!
//! The distinction is what lets a rebuild finish the job. When it resets the
//! derived counts and re-folds them, a derived row left at zero is one whose
//! last source is gone — an address that only ever appeared in a header a
//! later scan corrected — and it is deleted rather than left in the dropdown
//! at zero signal. A manual row is never deleted, however little signal it
//! carries: a bare address someone added by hand is indistinguishable from a
//! swept derived row and is still theirs.
