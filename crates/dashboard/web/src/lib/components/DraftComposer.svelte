  // Draft review composer — the surface behind every generated draft link
  // (`review_url` / `dashboard_url` from the CLI and MCP, and the cockpit's
  // Edit action). It is a Gmail-like editable composer, not an approval card:
  // the operator lands on the actual message and can change it before it goes.
  //
  // Safety contract, mirrored from crates/dashboard/src/handlers/drafts.rs:
  //   • Every edit and send carries the revision the operator was SHOWN as
  //     `expected_revision`, so a concurrent change returns 409 instead of
  //     silently overwriting content nobody reviewed.
  //   • Send is never implicit: an explicit confirmation precedes the POST,
  //     which carries `confirm: true`. That endpoint queues into the outbox
  //     cooldown — the shared scheduled sweep does the real SMTP behind the
  //     Governor gate — so this surface reports "queued", never "sent".
  //   • Sending is blocked while edits are unsaved, so the queued copy is
  //     always the copy the operator actually read.
  //   • A queued draft can be HELD: `send_after` is cleared, the row stays a
  //     `draft`, and the editor unlocks. Holding is never a discard — that is
  //     a separate, deliberate action.
  //   • CSRF is handled by the shared request() helper in $lib/api. Nothing
  //     here bypasses it, and there is no direct-send path.
