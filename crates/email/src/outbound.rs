//! Outbound send protections: a default actual-send cooldown (outbox queueing)
//! and a Governor decision gate that runs before any real SMTP transmission.
//!
//! These two protections exist to make "an agent sends mail too fast / without
//! oversight" structurally hard:
//!
//! 1. Any path that would actually transmit mail queues into the existing
//!    draft/outbox scheduled-send mechanism by default (see [`resolve_disposition`]).
//!    Real SMTP only happens later, when the scheduled-send sweep finds the item
//!    due — and only after Governor permits it.
//! 2. Before any real SMTP send, the caller runs [`gate`]. When Governor is
//!    configured as `required` it fails closed: missing/errored/denied/review
//!    all block the send. Only an explicit `allow` from Governor permits SMTP.
//!
//! Nothing in this module logs message bodies, full recipient addresses,
//! attachment bytes, or secrets. Governor receives only the sanitized attribute
//! **keys** an action exhibits (blind attribution) — never the content it scored.
